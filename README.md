## What is Text to Speech?

Text to Speech (T2S) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It is also known as “read aloud” technology.

## Why this T2S?

This technology will help those people who have difficulties with reading, especially those who struggle with decoding. By presenting the words auditorily, anyone can focus on the meaning of words instead of spending all their brain power trying to sound out the words.
